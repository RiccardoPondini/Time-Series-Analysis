This repository contains a detailed time series econometric study examining the relationship between the deflator of imports (dmbs), oil prices, exchange rates, and competitorsâ€™ export prices. The analysis explores how international cost pressures influence import inflation using various models and techniques.

The key steps and methods include:

-----Univariate analysis and ADF tests to confirm stationarity.

-----ARDL modeling and Pesaran-Shin-Smith tests for short-run dynamics and error correction modeling.

-----Engle-Granger and Johansen cointegration tests to identify long-run relationships.

-----VAR/VECM modeling to explore dynamic interdependencies.

-----Hodrick-Prescott filtering to separate trend and cyclical components.

-----Interpretation of adjustment speeds and cointegrating vectors.

The study is a robust demonstration of macroeconomic time series techniques applied to international price transmission and external shocks, offering useful insights for economic forecasting and policy modeling.
